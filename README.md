# Sketch-Plugin---NumGen

When you work with repetitive data, (e.g. data table), if you simply copy and paste the rows, all the numbers will be the same, which doesn't make your design look realistic. But if you manually change each of them, that could be quite tedious.

This plugin generates random formatted numbers. For now it includes CTR, clicks, costs, Impr. But you can modify the js files to include whatever kind of number you need.
